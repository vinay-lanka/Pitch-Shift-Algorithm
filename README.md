___

Pitch shifting is a sound manipulation technique in which the original pitch of the audio is increased or decreased to create the desired vocal effect. Pitch shifting is a core component of the popular music software _Autotune_. 

The techniques for the pitch shifting here are based on the Phase Vocoder method using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Wavelet Transform.
